## What is a Web Server?
A web server is a computer system that hosts websites and delivers web pages to users' browsers via the internet. It handles HTTP requests and serves content to clients. One popular example of a web server is **NGINX**.

## What is a Web Browser?
A web browser is a software application used to access information on the World Wide Web. It retrieves, presents, and traverses information resources on the web. Popular browsers include Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge.

## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of various services through the internet, including storage, processing power, and applications. It allows users to access and store data on remote servers rather than on local hard drives.

## Browser Engines
A browser engine is the core software component of a web browser. It is responsible for rendering web pages, executing JavaScript, and handling network requests. Different browsers use different engines, such as Gecko for Firefox and WebKit for Safari.
